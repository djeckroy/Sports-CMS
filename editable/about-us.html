About Us

Peterman Ratings began in response to a lack of meaningful rating systems for Tennis, Badminton and Squash. Starting in Tasmania, Australia it is aimed at these grassroots level individual sports. In local clubs, players are often rated by the “expert eye” of a senior player, a time consuming and subjective process. Comparing players abilities at a glance across the state, country or the world would be impossible. If there was a computerised system in place, it acted like a “black box” producing a number, with no uncertainty attached to the “rating”. I thought “there must be a better way”. The objective of Peterman Ratings provides accurate ratings by following players progress as they play their matches in pennants and tournaments. The algorithm is not a magical black box, but it is based on Bayesian principles. Basically, if a weaker player beats a stronger player, points gained by the weaker player will be larger than if the weaker player lost to the stronger player. The maths and statistics on the site are by Mr Peterman with contribution from Mr Barrie Robinson MSc.

We believe great clubs need a great rating system.

Needing to deploy the system on the World Wide Web, in Feb 2019 I put the project up for consideration for 3rd year students at the Launceston campus of The University of Tasmania. Thanks to Associate Professor Kristy De Sales for running this great service! The website was built from the ground up using a combination of web technologies. The maths engine for the site is powered by Maple™.

My appreciation to team members Marcus Grantham (Project Manager), James Watkins (Lead Programmer), Grant Upson (Database Programmer), Harinder Pal Singh (Lead Documenter), Adib Shadman Ornob (Client Liaison), Yusuf Uzun (Lead Designer) and Mingxin Wen (Lead Designer). 

If your club would like to join up send a message to petermanratings@gmail.com

Each club needs to nominate at least one Tournament Director. Each club can have more than one tournament director depending upon how big the club is (in case all the responsibilities can't be handled by one tournament director). They will be mainly responsible for uploading events like tournaments and pennants into the system for their club. Tournament directors can add or remove another tournament director for the same club. They can edit player details and events only for their club.

Administrators can manage all clubs. They are able to add, delete another administrator or tournament director. They can update player's wins and loses and correct false information. Administrator can update events and players of all available clubs in the system. At present I am the only Administrator.
